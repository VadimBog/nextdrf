Project Description:

This project serves as a showcase of my proficiency in Python and JavaScript programming languages, utilizing frameworks such as Django and Next.js. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to develop both back-end and front-end components and seamlessly integrate them using RESTful APIs powered by the Django Rest Framework. Additionally, I have created models and connected a PostgreSQL database to further enhance data management and persistence capabilities.

Key Features:

Python Backend with Django: Utilizing Django, a high-level Python web framework, I have implemented robust back-end functionalities to handle data processing, authentication, and business logic efficiently.

JavaScript Frontend with Next.js: Leveraging Next.js, a React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated web applications, I have crafted dynamic and interactive user interfaces to enhance the user experience.

Integration via REST API: By employing the Django Rest Framework, I have established RESTful APIs to facilitate seamless communication between the back-end and front-end layers. This allows for smooth data exchange and enables the creation of modern, responsive web applications.

Model Creation and PostgreSQL Database Connection: I have designed and implemented models to represent data entities within the application, and connected a PostgreSQL database to store and manage data efficiently. This ensures data integrity, scalability, and performance in handling large volumes of data.
